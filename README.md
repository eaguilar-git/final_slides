# Mar 19: Markdown presentations
### Slides with Beamer and `xaringan`

Our Markdown journey continues as we look at how to create slide decks for presentations. The syntax is pretty straightforward. In terms of professional output, the challenge is creating effective presentations. This is more about high-quality visualization, appropriate amount of text, etc.  

## Prep for class
- Some packages you will want:
  - `rmdformats`
  - `xaringan`
  - `Cairo`
- Yihui Xi has great stuff on all things markdown. [Chs 4.3 and 7 on presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html) are good for this week.
- Example: see [my book presentation repository](https://github.com/austin-hart-pols/QCSPA) for a customized `xaringan` example.
